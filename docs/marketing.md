# Yep Anywhere Marketing Plan

## Goal
Increase mind share for Yep Anywhere as the default mobile-first control plane for long-running coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and similar local agent workflows).

## Core Positioning

### Category
- Remote supervisor for coding agents (not another chat wrapper)

### One-line pitch
- Keep coding agents running on your machine, then supervise from your phone anywhere.

### Key differentiators
- Server-owned sessions continue when clients disconnect
- Mobile-first approvals and supervision
- Multi-session dashboard (many repos at once)
- Self-hosted with no external SaaS dependency
- Relay mode with end-to-end encryption

## Target Users
- Solo developers running long Claude Code/Codex sessions
- Indie hackers working away from desk
- Engineers managing multiple active coding sessions
- Security-conscious teams avoiding cloud repo upload workflows

## Messaging Pillars
1. Never lose momentum when away from desk
2. Approve and unblock agents from phone in seconds
3. Keep work on your own machine and network
4. Manage many active sessions in one place

## Content Strategy

### High-conversion content themes
- "Away from desk" rescue stories (agent blocked, approved from phone)
- "Before vs after" supervision workflows
- Security-first self-hosted workflows vs cloud sandbox workflows
- Multi-session management demos for real projects

### Channel mix
- Reddit (`r/ClaudeAI`, `r/codex`, relevant dev subreddits)
- X/Twitter short demo clips
- YouTube deep dives and walkthroughs
- Website docs + comparison pages

## Screenshots and Video Strategy

### Why this matters
People need to see the product in action to understand value quickly. Static claims are weaker than visual proof of remote approval, live session continuity, and mobile workflow speed.

### Screenshot plan
Create a repeatable screenshot pack for every release:
- Mobile lock-screen approval flow
- Session dashboard with multiple active repos
- Resume and continue after disconnect
- Security/architecture overview (direct vs relay)
- Side-by-side "without Yep Anywhere / with Yep Anywhere"

Screenshot standards:
- Use realistic project/session names
- Show timestamps/status badges for credibility
- Keep typography readable on small screens
- Export both portrait (mobile) and landscape (site/social)

### Promo video plan
Produce short, outcome-driven videos:
- 20-30s hook clips for social
- 60-90s product narrative clips
- 4-8 minute workflow walkthroughs

Mandatory moments in promo videos:
- Agent starts task on desktop
- User leaves desk
- Approval/prompt from phone
- Task continues and completes
- User returns with finished result

### YouTube plan
Create a recurring YouTube series:
- Episode 1: "Why remote agent supervision matters"
- Episode 2: "Approve Claude Code/Codex runs from phone"
- Episode 3: "Multi-session workflow across projects"
- Episode 4: "Security model and self-hosting setup"
- Episode 5: "Real day-in-the-life coding workflow"

YouTube optimization checklist:
- Problem-first titles (not feature-first)
- Strong thumbnail with phone + terminal context
- Chapters for setup, workflow, and outcomes
- Link docs and quickstart in first lines of description
- End each video with one next action (install, docs, demo)

## Launch and Distribution Cadence

### Weekly cadence
- 1 short demo clip
- 1 written post (workflow, lesson, comparison)
- 1 community thread response with concrete example
- 1 YouTube upload every 1-2 weeks

### Monthly cadence
- One major "state of remote coding agents" post
- One feature spotlight with updated screenshots/video
- One user story/case study

## Website and Collateral
- Add "How it works" animation or sequence on homepage
- Add competitor comparison page (focused on workflow and security)
- Add visual feature matrix for mobile supervision use cases
- Add downloadable media kit (screenshots, logos, short product explainer)

## Proof and Trust Assets
- Public architecture/security summary
- Real user workflow clips and quotes
- Transparent roadmap section
- Changelog highlights tied to user pain points

## KPIs
- Landing page conversion to install/quickstart
- Time-to-first-mobile-approval completion rate
- Weekly active users on mobile supervision actions
- Demo clip watch-through rate
- YouTube click-through and retention
- Community mention velocity (Reddit/X)

## 30-60-90 Day Plan

### Days 1-30
- Ship core screenshot pack
- Produce first two promo videos
- Publish first YouTube walkthrough
- Add homepage "remote approval in 30s" section

### Days 31-60
- Publish comparison page and security explainer
- Launch weekly content cadence
- Publish two user workflow case studies

### Days 61-90
- Double down on highest-performing channels
- Expand YouTube series into advanced workflows
- Launch partner/community contribution spotlight posts

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Create a repeatable capture script/checklist for screenshots and demo clips
2. Record one flagship 90-second promo video showing end-to-end away-from-desk flow
3. Publish first YouTube walkthrough and repurpose it into short clips for Reddit/X
