# Yep Anywhere vs Anthropic Remote Control — Differentiator Tracker

Last updated: 2026-02-25

Anthropic's "Remote Control" (research preview, Max only) lets you continue a local Claude Code CLI session from the Claude mobile app or claude.ai/code. This doc tracks where Yep Anywhere is ahead, at parity, and behind.

Basically Yepanywhere is a "remote desktop" into all your AI agent sessions, lets you resume/create/control everything.

Claude Remote Control is "interact with any currently running claude CLI session". No ability to create new ones or review past sessions.

## Details

## Where Yep Is Ahead

### Session Management
- **Create sessions from phone** — RC cannot create new sessions; requires `claude remote-control` or `/rc` in terminal first
- **Queue messages while agent is working** — Send follow-up messages mid-turn; they queue or steer. RC blocks input while a turn is processing
- **Multi-session dashboard** — View all projects and sessions in a tiered inbox (Needs Attention → Active → Recent). RC shows a flat session list. It does not show all local sessions, only ones currently with a claude CLI process open and configured to enable remote access.
- **Session starring & archiving** — Organize sessions for quick access or cleanup
- **Session cloning/forking** — Branch from any message to explore alternatives

### Multi-Provider
- **Claude, Codex, Codex-OSS, Gemini, OpenCode** — Single UI for multiple agent runtimes. RC is Claude-only
- **Provider badges and filtering** — See which provider is running at a glance

### Connectivity & Security
- **Self-hosted relay** — Your relay, your infrastructure. RC routes all traffic through Anthropic's API
- **End-to-end encryption** — NaCl (XSalsa20-Poly1305) + SRP-6a authentication. The relay server sees only ciphertext. RC uses TLS to Anthropic's servers (Anthropic can see traffic)
- **Direct LAN/Tailscale mode** — Zero cloud dependency option. RC always goes through Anthropic
- **Works with API keys** — No subscription requirement. RC requires Pro or Max plan ($20+/mo)


### Visibility & Monitoring
- **Global activity stream** — See all file modifications across all projects in real time
- **Source control page** — Git status, staged/unstaged files, syntax-highlighted diffs
- **Agents page** — Real-time view of all running processes with state, uptime, context usage, queue depth

### Developer / Power-User
- **Permission modes** — Bypass (full YOLO), Accept Edits, Plan mode. RC requires manual approval for every tool call with no auto-approve option
- **Thinking/effort control** — Toggle adaptive thinking and set effort level (low/medium/high/max) from mobile
