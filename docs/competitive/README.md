# Competitive Landscape

Analysis of similar tools in the AI coding agent supervisor space.

**[Feature Matrix](feature-matrix.md)** — Full checklist comparison across all tools.

## First-Party Tools

Official apps from AI providers:

| Tool | Type | Key Differentiator |
|------|------|-------------------|
| [Codex App](codex-app.md) | macOS + cloud | Cloud sandboxes, automations, GitHub integration |
| [Claude Code Desktop](claude-code-desktop.md) | Desktop (Electron) | Remote execution, Cowork for non-coders |

## Third-Party Tools (Agent Supervisors)

| Tool | Type | Agents | Key Differentiator |
|------|------|--------|-------------------|
| [AionUi](aionui.md) | Desktop + WebUI + Telegram | 17 (ACP) | Messaging platform bots, cron scheduling, Zed ACP bridges |
| [emdash](emdash.md) | Desktop app | 20+ | Multi-agent orchestration, git worktrees |
| [Conductor](conductor.md) | macOS app | Claude, Codex | Git worktree isolation |
| [HAPI](hapi.md) | Web + CLI | Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode | CLI-wrapper architecture, terminal page |
| [Happy](happy.md) | Mobile + CLI | Claude, Codex | Voice commands, native mobile apps |

## The "Claw" Ecosystem (Adjacent Category)

"Claw" is now a recognized category term (Karpathy coined it, Willison validated it, Feb 2026) for AI agents that run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging, and schedule autonomous tasks. These are **runtimes that wrap LLM APIs**, not agent supervisors like yepanywhere. But they overlap enough to track.

| Project | Stars | Language | Key Differentiator |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | 215k | TypeScript | The original. 38+ channels, 5,700+ skills on ClawHub |
| [Nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | 22.4k | Python | ~4K lines. Research-friendly. MCP integration |
| [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | 17.2k | Go | <10MB RAM, runs on $10 RISC-V boards |
| [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) | 16k | Rust | <5MB RAM, single binary, 22+ providers |
| [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) | 10.2k | TypeScript | Container isolation (Docker/Apple Container) |
| [Moltworker](https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker) | 8.6k | TypeScript | Serverless on Cloudflare Workers |
| [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | 2.6k | Rust | WASM sandboxing, PostgreSQL, defense-in-depth |

**Why we're different:** Claws are runtimes — they manage LLM API calls, tool execution, and session state. We're a supervisor/relay — we manage existing agents (Claude Code, Codex) that handle their own execution. See the [Seneschal competitive analysis](../../../assistant-data/assistants/scout/docs/seneschal-ideas.md) for detailed positioning.

## Common Features Across Competitors

Most tools in this space provide:
- Multi-session dashboard
- Real-time streaming
- Permission approval UI
- Session persistence

## yepanywhere Differentiators

Features we have that competitors lack:
- **Tiered inbox** (Needs Attention → Active → Recent → Unread)
- **Conversation fork/clone** from any message point
- **Global activity stream** across sessions
- **Real-time context usage** tracking
- **Bulk operations** (multi-select archive/star/delete)
- **Draft persistence** (auto-save messages)
- **Server-owned processes** (survives client disconnects)
- **E2E encryption + relay** for remote access (Happy also has this)

## Common Gaps

Features competitors have that we should consider:
- **Git worktree creation** per session (emdash, Conductor, HAPI)
- **Working tree diff viewer** (most competitors)
- **Diff commenting** (Claude Desktop)
- **Scheduling/automations** (Codex App, AionUi)
- **Messaging platform bots** as mobile proxy (AionUi — Telegram/Lark/DingTalk)
