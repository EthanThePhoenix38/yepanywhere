  <p>In late 2025 and early 2026, Anthropic sent takedown notices to several third-party Claude Code clients. We want to be transparent about how Yep Anywhere differs from those projects.</p>

  <h3>What Got Blocked</h3>
  <p>Projects like OpenCode, Crush (Charmbracelet), and Windsurf were blocked for <strong>spoofing the Claude Code client identity</strong> to access Claude Max subscription pricing ($200/month) instead of paying per-token API rates.</p>

  <p>Claude Max subscriptions offer dramatically cheaper access than API pricing (users reported $1000+ monthly API costs reduced to $200). The blocked tools would:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send fake HTTP headers pretending to be the official Claude Code CLI</li>
    <li>Trick Anthropic's servers into granting subscription-tier pricing</li>
    <li>Provide their own alternative UI while freeloading on pricing meant only for Anthropic's official tool</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An Anthropic engineer confirmed: <blockquote>"We tightened our safeguards against spoofing the Claude Code harness."</blockquote></p>

  <h3>How Yep Anywhere Is Different</h3>
  <p>Yep Anywhere does <strong>none of the above</strong>. Here's what we actually do:</p>

  <p><strong>1. We use the official SDK.</strong> We depend on <code>@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk</code>, Anthropic's official published SDK. We call the SDK's <code>query()</code> function directly without modification or header spoofing.</p>

  <p><strong>2. We don't handle authentication.</strong> Users authenticate via the Claude CLI directly (<code>claude login</code>) or by setting <code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code>. We never touch, intercept, or proxy OAuth tokens.</p>

  <p><strong>3. We don't spoof client identity.</strong> Our code makes no attempt to impersonate Claude Code or any other client. We pass requests to the SDK as-is, which identifies itself appropriately.</p>

  <p><strong>4. We're a remote interface, not a replacement.</strong> Yep Anywhere is a mobile-friendly supervisor for Claude Code sessions running on your own machine. Think of it like SSH for AI agents&mdash;we provide remote access to sessions, not a replacement client.</p>

        <td>No (custom API calls)</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Handles user auth</td>
        <td>Yes (OAuth proxy/interception)</td>
        <td>No &mdash; users authenticate via CLI directly</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Our Stance</h3>
  <p>We believe our approach aligns with Anthropic's terms of service. Users pay for their own Claude access through legitimate channels, and we provide a remote interface to manage sessions. We're not trying to game pricing or impersonate official tools.</p>

  <p>If Anthropic has concerns about our implementation, we welcome the conversation.</p>
